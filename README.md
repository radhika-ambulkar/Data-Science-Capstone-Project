# Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Perform EDA and derive Insights from the CAR DETAILS dataset using Various Data Analysis and Data Visualization libraries of Python such as Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn. Create and Deploy a ML Model Which can be accessed by all, using Streamlit and GitHub.

The dataset consists of car details with the following columns:
name: The model and variant of the car.
year: The manufacturing year of the car.

seller_type: The type of seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer).
transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
owner: The ownership status (e.g., First Owner, Second Owner).
the graphical analysis,ml model file and app.py is attatched in the repo.
